# **TelegramConstellate: A comprehensive tool for networking Telegram data**

✅ This code (avaliable here on GitHub or directly on [Google Colab](https://bit.ly/telegram-networks-colab)), developed by [Isabela Rocha](https://github.com/rocha-isabela/) (Brazil), builds co-occurrence networks (or constellations) from Telegram data previously scraped with [Ergon Cugler de Moraes Silva](https://github.com/ergoncugler)'s [TelegramScrap](https://github.com/ergoncugler/web-scraping-telegram/). It applies SimHash clustering to overcome a key limitation of Telegram data: the platform does not directly indicate when the same message has been shared across different groups or users. By computing a SimHashID for each message, the code identifies messages that are identical or nearly identical, even if small variations exist (such as different links or minor text edits). These shared or near-shared messages form the backbone of the network: nodes (Groups or Authors) are linked whenever they contain messages with the same SimHashID, effectively revealing hidden connections of content circulation across the platform. You can also read about this code on its [official paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17459043).

The tool allows the user to define which variable should represent nodes (Groups or the Messages themselves), while edges reflect co-occurrence strength. The code supports filtering clusters by size, selecting between different edge weighting schemes (presence vs. pairs), and exporting results for further analysis.

✅ The networks are enriched with key metrics such as node degree and strength, and as the data is exported in CSV (edges and nodes), the code provides researchers with the toolkits needed for further Social Network Analysis (SNA). The code also generates an in-notebook preview: edges are drawn as thin lines, clusters are color-coded by community detection, and users can control the number of labels shown.

✅ The code is open-source and adaptable. It is intended for research and analytical use, with responsibility for its use and adaptations resting with the user. Users should ensure compliance with Telegram’s terms of service and data privacy regulations when analyzing communication networks.

✅ Once the networks are built, they can be combined with other analytical pipelines. For example, the SimHash-based clustering ensures that identical or near-identical messages are grouped, which enables the study of narrative propagation, cross-group message diffusion, and coordinated behavior. Exported networks can be explored through standard SNA measures (e.g., centrality, modularity) or integrated into more advanced workflows, such as Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and persistent homology for narrative dynamics.
